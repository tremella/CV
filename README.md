Since mid-2020 I have been learning web development: first independently, and now with the support of Makers.

- I presented these insights to senior management on a quarterly basis. This involved a broad range of research on different Australian industries, from agriculture, to retail, to healthcare and education.

### Hobbies

In my spare time I enjoy bouldering and music, and I'm an amateur mycologist. I also enjoy annoying my family with extremely dumb jokes and bad puns. If you've read this far, please enjoy this dumb joke:

Q: What's the difference between a legal document and a cat? :cat:

A: One has pauses at the end of its clauses; the other has _clawses_ at the end of its _pawses_ üêæ
