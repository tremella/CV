In my spare time I enjoy bouldering and music, and I'm also an amateur mycologist. I can play a few instruments and sing well, and I really love visiting galleries and museums. I also enjoy annoying my family with extremely dumb jokes and bad puns. If you've read this far, please enjoy this dumb joke:

Q: What's the difference between a legal document and a cat?

A: One has pauses at the end of its clauses; the other has _clawses_ at the end of its _pawses_
